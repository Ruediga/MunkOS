# MunkOS

Future Operating System very early on in development for learning purposes with simplicity in mind.

Currently, MunkOS only consists of a kernel (with very minimal functionality), supports the x86_64 architecture for now, and boots with the Limine Bootloader.

# Building

Since I don't provide a custom toolchain script yet, compilation is only possible on x86_64 hosts.

You're going to have the least problems using Linux distro like Arch (or derivatives) (WSL may work too) to build from source yourself. Building requires the following packages, which you can install with your distros package manager (pacman, apt, nix, apk, ...):

### Arch / Manjaro (& other pacman based distros)

> sudo pacman -S git gcc build-essential make xorriso gdisk mtools curl python3 qemu

### Ubuntu / Debian / Mint (& other apt based distros)

> sudo apt install git gcc build-essential make gdisk mtools curl python3 qemu-system-x86

In case the xorriso installation fails, try running `sudo add-apt-repository universe` and then `sudo apt install xorriso` again.

The following make-targets build the image / iso and run it with a default qemu config

```sh
run-iso-bios
run-iso-uefi
run-img-bios
run-img-uefi
```

Of course, a `clean` target exists too, and the `clean-full` target gets rid of everything.

If the kernel crashes or something doesn't work for you when testing on real hardware, and you don't have the same hardware as I do, your pc is broken and you should demand a refund from the manufacturer.

### Third party

# Features

Currently, I prioritize work on the kernel.

### Kernel

This list will get a rework as soon as I care to do that

- [x] PMM (buddy / bitmap)
- [x] VMM
- [x] Kheap (slab)
- [x] Interrupts
- [x] ACPI
- [x] I/O APIC
- [x] LAPIC
- [x] Timer Interface (WIP)
- [x] PS2 driver
- [x] SMP
- [x] Tasks
- [x] Scheduler
- [x] PCIe
- [x] NVME driver
- [x] GPT / MBR
- [ ] FAT
- [ ] ext2
- [-] devices
- [-] VFS
- [-] devtmpfs
- [ ] Userspace


### TODO

#### FIXME

scheduler API

tlb shootdown

pci multiple bridges?

#### Features

a proper device / driver interface

syscalls

finish vfs

uACPI

### Long Term Goals

I want MunkOS to be a primarily dependency free OS, so replacing third party libraries I use for convinience during development with my own is something I intend to do at some pointâ„¢.
